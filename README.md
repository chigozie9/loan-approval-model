## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Logistic regression and decision tree models
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Results
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of XX%, while the decision tree reached XX%.

## Repository Structure
- `loan_approval_model.ipynb` – Main analysis notebook
- `data/` – Folder containing raw and cleaned datasets
- `images/` – Charts and visualizations used in the report

## How to Run
Clone the repo, install dependencies, and run the notebook in Jupyter Lab or Google Colab.
